Yardarm is an OpenAPI 3 SDK Generator for C#. It provides various tools that will generate an SDK for a valid OpenAPI specification.

## Project Goals

- Present a .NET SDK that uses modern .NET/C# paradigms
- High performance, both for generating SDKs and SDK consumers
- Highly extensible
- Mitigate backward compatibility issues as new SDKs are generated from new versions of an OpenAPI specification

## Features

- Works with valid OpenAPI 3 specs, in JSON or YAML format
- Many generation options
  - Command Line Application
  - Docker Image
  - In-code via library
  - .NET Global Tool
  - MSBuild SDK
- Generates a SDK using modern C# patterns and practices as follows:
  - Asynchronous methods with cancellation tokens
  - Nullable reference types
  - Polymorphism
  - Interfaces with concrete implementations
  - XML documentation for IntelliSense
  - Portable PDBs with embedded source code
- Fast SDK generation
  - Doesn't make C# files on disk and run MSBuild
  - Uses Roslyn to directly generate AST and compile in memory
- Built-in NuGet support
  - Generate valid `.nupkg` files directly, with correct dependencies
  - Target multiple framework versions in one package automatically
  - Automatically restore packages required for compilation
- Highly extensible SDK generation
  - Built around plugable extensions that add additional features or modify the C# code used for compilation
  - Includes out-of-the-box plugins for common scenarios
    - `Newtonsoft.Json` serialization/deserialization
    - `System.Text.Json` serialization/deserialization
    - `Microsoft.Extensions.Http` for dependency injection
- Highly extensible SDK
  - Will allow the SDK consumer to extend the behaviors on the client side
  - Pluggable configuration for things like TLS and base urls
  - Add `HttpMessageHandler` instances to the `HttpClient` stack
  - Mockable API interfaces for unit testing
