  description: "# Introduction\nThe Merchant API enables you to connect seamlessly\
    \ and securely to our [Omni-Channel Payments Platform](https://www.payroc.com/).\n\
    \nOur APIs are built around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)\
    \ principles and [OpenAPI Specification](https://www.openapis.org/) definitions.\n\
    Complying to such industry standards means that we can offer developers a much\
    \ better experience by exposing predictable resource-oriented URL's as well as\
    \ a comprehensive range of HTTP response codes and verbs.\nMoreover, you have\
    \ the possibility to enable and take full advantage of [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS)\
    \ controls to provide out-of-the-box `Discoverability` and `Functional-Awareness`\
    \ for your integrations.\n\nGet started on building full-featured payment applications\
    \ and join us in the Revolution of Intelligent Retail.\n\n# Authentication\nThe\
    \ Merchant API uses a combination of API Keys and [Java Web Tokens (JWT)](https://jwt.io/)\
    \ to authenticate requests.\nAPI Key's hold all the necessary information for\
    \ issuing JWT access tokens which in turn are required to access protected resources\
    \ and operations.\nTherefore, before you can start making any calls, you must\
    \ generate an API Key and use it to obtain access tokens.\n\nPlease, make yourself\
    \ familiar with the following security schemes before proceeding:\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject:\
    \ <security-definitions> -->\n## Generating an API Key\nThe API supports two levels\
    \ of authentication. Our consumers can either authenticate on a merchant level\
    \ and have their API Keys limited to the scope of a specific merchant or, if you\
    \ are one of our ISV (Independent Software Vendor) partners, you can have only\
    \ one API Key for a whole integration which may consist of more than one merchant.\n\
    \nAlthough it is handy for ISVs to have one key that can authenticate in multiple\
    \ merchant accounts, they can still use merchant-level authentication if they\
    \ want to have more control and keep their merchant authentication separate.\n\
    In this case, the gateway will require an extra header called `X-Integration-ID`\
    \ - containing the integration's identifier - to be sent in every request.\n\n\
    **How to generate Merchant-Level API Keys?**\n\n1. [Log into the SelfCare System](https://payments.uat.payroc.com/merchant/selfcare)\
    \ with the credentials you received in the welcome email.\n2. Under *Settings*,\
    \ navigate to *API Keys*, and then click the `NEW API KEY` button.\n4. Enter an\
    \ alias and set the permission modes for each Sub-API.\n5. Select the terminals\
    \ that you want the API Key to be allowed to operate.\n6. Back on the list, choose\
    \ the action `View Authentication Key` to be able to see your Key's authentication\
    \ token.\n\n**How to generate Integration-Level API Keys?**\n\nISV integrations\
    \ are managed by our support and integration teams. Our team will be happy to\
    \ create your API Key when requested.<br />\nOnce created, the authentication\
    \ token is sent by email in an encrypted file and our team will guide you on how\
    \ to access its content.\n\nNote: Since ISV developers are not able to create\
    \ their own keys, we recommend Merchant-Level authentication during integration\
    \ and test phases as a way to speed up development and avoid the overhead of contacting\
    \ members of the support team.\n\n## Obtaining an Access Token\nIn order to obtain\
    \ an access token you must use the [authenticate](#operation/authenticate) operation\
    \ passing your API Key in the `HTTP Authorization` header with `Basic` authentication\
    \ scheme.\n\nIn the snippet below we show how to achieve that using [cURL](https://github.com/curl/curl).\
    \ However, if you are not familiar with command line tools we recommend [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).\n\
    \n```\ncurl https://payments.uat.payroc.com/merchant/api/v1/account/authenticate\
    \ \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Basic <Merchant API Key>\"\n```\n\nFor every successful\
    \ request you should receive a response just like the one below containing the\
    \ information associated with your credentials, such as hours to expiry and privileges.\n\
    Include the JWT Token from the `token` property in the `Authorization` header\
    \ with `Bearer` authentication scheme for following requests to prove your identity\
    \ and access protected resources.\n\n```\n{\n    \"audience\": \"payments.uat.payroc.com\"\
    ,\n    \"boundTo\": \"My API Key\",\n    \"tokenType\": \"Bearer\",\n    \"token\"\
    : \"<JWT Access Token>\",\n    \"expiresIn\": 1,\n    \"enableHypermedia\": true,\n\
    \    \"roles\": [],\n    \"allowedTerminals\": []\n}\n```\n\nFor security reasons,\
    \ access tokens expire after a certain amount of time.\nTherefore, your application\
    \ must implement a mechanism to keep track of the `expiresIn` property which is\
    \ the number of hours the token is valid for.\n\n**Note:** The lifespan of a token\
    \ must not be hard-coded on the client-side as the value of `expiresIn` property\
    \ is subject to change without prior notice.\n\n## Making Authenticated Calls\n\
    Apart from the [authenticate](#operation/authenticate) operation, the entire API\
    \ requires `Bearer` authentication scheme and expects a valid JWT token as proof\
    \ of identity.\nThe [cURL](https://github.com/curl/curl) snippet below is an example\
    \ of how to use your access token, in this specific case, to request the list\
    \ of available terminals in your account.\n\n```\ncurl https://payments.uat.payroc.com/merchant/api/v1/account/terminals?pageSize=10\
    \ \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer\
    \ <JWT Token>\"\n```\n\n**Note:** The API will issue a response with status `401\
    \ Unauthorized` for requests carrying an expired JWT.\n\n# API Requests\nWe provide\
    \ developers looking to integrate with our solutions with a full-featured **Sandbox**.\n\
    \n- Sandbox URL: https://payments.uat.payroc.com/merchant/\n\nIn order to\
    \ perform actions on the API's resources you must combine your requests with the\
    \ proper [HTTP Request Method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods).\n\
    \nThe Merchant API supports the following HTTP Methods which are sometimes referred\
    \ as *HTTP Verbs*:\n\nHTTP Method  | Description\n------------ | -------------\n\
    [GET](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) | It requests\
    \ a representation of the specified resource. Requests using `GET` are read-only.\n\
    [POST](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) | It is\
    \ used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in\
    \ state on the server.\n[PATCH](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PATCH)\
    \ | It is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.\n[DELETE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/DELETE)\
    \ | It deletes / cancels / reverts the specified resource.\n\n## Request Identifiers\n\
    The Merchant API assigns a unique identifier for every request that comes in.\
    \ You can find your requests' identifiers either in the `X-Request-Id` header\
    \ or in the Error field `debugIdentifier`.\n\nRequest ID's are part of an effort\
    \ to speed troubleshooting by facilitating communication between clients and our\
    \ support team.\nSince we keep track of all request identifiers in our log files,\
    \ you just need to inform the request's identifier when asking us to assist you\
    \ with problems that might come up during your integrations.\n\n## Customer Account\
    \ Payloads\n\nClient applications need to be able to send the customers' account\
    \ details when generating payments, initiating unreferenced refunds and registering\
    \ secure credentials. \nThis information is expected in the form of payloads which\
    \ varies based on the mechanism used to capture the account/card details.\n\n\
    For instance, when the card details are manually inputted, a `KEYED` payload is\
    \ expected. However, an `EMV` payload is always expected for contact and contactless\
    \ EMV transactions.\nIt is worth mentioning that the proper use of payloads also\
    \ depend on the channel over which your terminal is operating. In the table below\
    \ we show the supported payloads for each of the three available channels:\n\n\
    Channel                      | Supported Payloads\n----------------------------\
    \ | -------------------------\nWEB (eCommerce)              | `KEYED`, `SECURE_CREDENTIALS`,\
    \ `DIGITAL_WALLET`\nPOS (Cardholder Present)     | `KEYED`, `EMV`, `RAW`, `MAG_STRIPE`\n\
    MOTO (Mail/Telephone Order)  | `KEYED`, `SECURE_CREDENTIALS`\n\n## Request Headers\n\
    HTTP Header  | Description\n------------ | -------------\n[Accept](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept)\
    \ | The response format expected by your application.<br />The Merchant API only\
    \ produces `application/json` response format.\n[Accept-Language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language)\
    \ | It advertises which languages the client is able to understand, and which\
    \ locale variant is preferred.<br />The Merchant API fully supports English `en`\
    \ and French `fr` languages.\n[Content-Type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type)\
    \ | The body format of the request your application is sending to the API.<br\
    \ />The Merchant API only consumes `application/json` content type.\n[Authorization](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization)\
    \ | It must contain the credentials (API Key or JWT Access Token) to authenticate\
    \ your application.<br />The API will issue a `401 Unauthorized` response with\
    \ the `WWW-Authenticate` header attached if your application fails to use this\
    \ header properly.\n[X-Integration-ID](#) | It should be sent in every call by\
    \ ISV integrations that use Merchant-Level API Keys for authentication\n\n## Partial\
    \ Updates\nPartial update requests are signaled with the HTTP method `PATCH`.\n\
    To perform partial updates, clients must specify only the properties that have\
    \ changed.\n\n**Note:** To clear the content of a property, supply an empty value.\n\
    \n## Testing Requests\nEventually it will be necessary to perform some transactions.\n\
    For resources such as testing credit cards and simulated responses, see [Testing\
    \ Resources](https://developers.worldnetpayments.com/selfcare:integration_docs:introduction#testing_resources).\n\
    \n# API Responses\nClient applications must be able to handle JSON body format\
    \ as well as a range of [HTTP status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)\
    \ when processing responses.\nSome resources might also include contextual hypermedia\
    \ links. We strongly recommend that clients use these links to request more information\
    \ or perform additional actions on a given resource.\n\n## HTTP Status Codes\n\
    The Merchant API has adopted a comprehensive range of status codes where `2XX`\
    \ statuses are returned for successful requests and `4XX` or `5XX` for failed\
    \ requests.\n\nThe full range of status codes supported by this API:\n\nHTTP Status\
    \ Code  | Description\n----------------- | -------------\n[200 OK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200)\
    \ | Indicates that the request has succeeded.\n[201 Created](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/201)\
    \ | Indicates that the request has succeeded and has led to the creation of a\
    \ resource.\n[204 No Content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/204)\
    \ | Indicates that the server successfully executed the method but returns no\
    \ response body.<br />This status is sent specifically to respond to `DELETE`\
    \ requests.\n[400 Bad Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/400)\
    \ | Indicates that the server cannot or will not process the request due to malformed\
    \ request syntax or schema violation.\n[401 Unauthorized](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/401)\
    \ | Indicates that the request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication\
    \ credentials.<br />This status is sent with a `WWW-Authenticate` header that\
    \ contains information on how to authorize correctly.\n[403 Forbidden](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/403)\
    \ | Indicates that the server understood the request but refuses to authorize\
    \ it due to the lack of permissions.<br />Re-authenticating will make no difference\
    \ until the proper permissions and terminals are added to the API Key.\n[404 Not\
    \ Found](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404) | Indicates\
    \ that the server cannot find the requested resource.\n[405 Method Not Allowed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/405)\
    \ | Indicates that the request method is known by the server but is not supported\
    \ by the target resource.\n[406 Not Acceptable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/406)\
    \ | Indicates that the server cannot produce a response matching the value from\
    \ `Accept` header.\n[415 Unsupported Media Type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/415)\
    \ | Indicates that the server refuses to accept the request because the payload\
    \ format described by the `Content-Type` is unsupported.\n[422 Unprocessable Entity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/422)\
    \ | Indicates that the server understands the content type of the request entity,\
    \ and the syntax of the request entity is correct, but it was unable to proceed\
    \ due to semantic errors or failed business validations.\n[500 Internal Server\
    \ Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500) | Indicates\
    \ that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling\
    \ the request.\n[501 Not Implemented](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/501)\
    \ | Indicates that the server does not yet support the functionality required\
    \ to fulfill the request, but might in the future.\n\n## Error Handling\nIn the\
    \ event of a failure, the Merchant API returns an error response body that includes\
    \ additional details in the format below:\n\n```\n{\n    \"debugIdentifier\":\
    \ \"ae6d75eb-381b-4a01-9f49-fdff12e3848b\",\n    \"details\": [\n        {\n \
    \           \"errorCode\": \"X_400_002\",\n            \"errorMessage\": \"Unable\
    \ to deserialize value\",\n            \"source\": {\n                \"location\"\
    : \"BODY\",\n                \"resource\": \"TipType\",\n                \"property\"\
    : \"type\",\n                \"value\": \"VARIABLE\",\n                \"expected\"\
    : \"Acceptable values: [PERCENTAGE, FIXED_AMOUNT]\"\n            }\n        }\n\
    \    ]\n}\n```\n\nError messages are intended to help developers to fix any problems\
    \ that may come up during integration.<br />However, if you ever have a hard time\
    \ troubleshooting an issue or even wish to make a suggestion, do not hesitate\
    \ to [contact us](https://payroc.com/contacts/).\nDo not forget to send\
    \ us the `debugIdentifier` along with your inquiries.\n\n## HATEOAS (Hypermedia\
    \ Links)\n[HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) is a powerful mechanism\
    \ when it comes to enabling self-discoverability, reducing invalid state transition\
    \ calls and protecting your application against unexpected changes on resources\
    \ URL's.\n\nThis snippet from a sample `payments` response shows the list of hypermedia\
    \ controls that represent the operations available for the newly created payment\
    \ resource.\n\n```\n\"links\": [\n    {\n        \"rel\": \"capture\",\n     \
    \   \"method\": \"PATCH\"\n        \"href\": \"https://payments.uat.payroc.com/merchant/api/v1/transaction/payments/GH2AERQEJS/capture\"\
    \n    },\n    {\n        \"rel\": \"refund\",\n        \"method\": \"POST\"\n\
    \        \"href\": \"https://payments.uat.payroc.com/merchant/api/v1/transaction/payments/GH2AERQEJS/refunds\"\
    \n    },\n    {\n        \"rel\": \"update\",\n        \"method\": \"PATCH\"\n\
    \        \"href\": \"https://payments.uat.payroc.com/merchant/api/v1/transaction/payments/GH2AERQEJS\"\
    \n    },\n    {\n        \"rel\": \"self\",\n        \"method\": \"GET\"\n   \
    \     \"href\": \"https://payments.uat.payroc.com/merchant/api/v1/transaction/payments/GH2AERQEJS\"\
    \n    },\n    {\n        \"rel\": \"reverse\",\n        \"method\": \"DELETE\"\
    \n        \"href\": \"https://payments.uat.payroc.com/merchant/api/v1/transaction/payments/GH2AERQEJS\"\
    \n    }\n]\n```\n\n# Pagination\nThe Merchant API features a cursor-based pagination\
    \ which is sometimes referred as continuation token pagination.\nThis pagination\
    \ approach works by returning a pointer to a specific item in the dataset. On\
    \ subsequent requests, the server returns results after the given pointer.\n\n\
    Clients don't need to worry about implementing complex pagination mechanism in\
    \ their applications as we return, for all paginated resources, a hypermedia link\
    \ that can be used to load more results.\nIt is important to mention that the\
    \ response containing the last elements will not contain a `next` hyperlink. We\
    \ do that so you know that there are no more elements to load.\n```\n\"links\"\
    : [\n    {\n        \"rel\": \"next\",\n        \"method\": \"GET\"\n        \"\
    href\": \"https://payments.uat.payroc.com/merchant/api/v1/account/terminals?next=CWY4XRGUUY\"\
    \n    }\n]\n```\n\nThe default number of elements per page is `10` and the maximum\
    \ is `100`, but it can be changed by adding the query parameter `pageSize` to\
    \ requests as follows:\n```\ncurl https://payments.uat.payroc.com/merchant/api/v1/account/terminals?pageSize=5\
    \ \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer\
    \ <JWT Token>\"\n```\n\n**Note:** For performance reasons, the elements inside\
    \ of a paginated list only represent a compact version of the resource listed.\n\
    To retrieve the full version of a given resource, client applications must make\
    \ a subsequent request using the proper hypermedia link.\n\n# Versioning\nVersioning\
    \ ensures that changes are backward compatible. The Merchant API uses a major\
    \ and minor version nomenclature to manage changes.\n\n## Major Versions\nMajor\
    \ version numbers will reflect in the REST URL, for example `/api/v1/transaction/payments`.\n\
    \nCurrently, **v1** is the only supported major version.\n\n## Minor Versions\n\
    Minor and backward-compatible changes will be advertised via `X-API-Version` response\
    \ header, for example `X-API-Version: 2020-01-01`.\n\nDevelopers should use this\
    \ header to keep track of new features and optimizations that might benefit their\
    \ applications.\n"

    The Secure Credentials feature was designed to provide online merchants with the ability to store payment credentials for subsequent use in a secure and PCI-compliant manner within our platform.
    It eliminates the need for merchants to store customer cards and accounts locally on their own systems, avoiding the significant systems and financial overhead of managing their own PCI compliance and registration processes.

    By using the Secure Credentials feature a merchant can access the stored payment details through a ‘token’ number to generate payments on behalf of the cardholder for both ad-hoc and recurring payments.

    ### How it works

    When registering payment credentials, clients may provide a reference value to identify the stored credentials on both sides.
    Although the `Merchant Reference` is optional and auto-generated by our gateway when not provided, clients must still be able to store it on their side to perform CRUD operations on existing credentials.
    In fact, all information from secure credentials registration responses can be stored without any PCI security implications.

    To perform transactions with stored credentials, clients must provide the unique token number generated by our platform.<br />
    This token looks just like a regular card number and can be easily recognized by its BIN "296753".

    The Secure Credentials feature was designed for merchants who want to:

    - Allow customers to make subsequent purchases without having to re-enter card details.
    - Retain cardholder details without the overhead of managing their own PCI compliance.
    - Provide subscription-based payments.
    - Facilitate recurring transactions.

    The Payments feature comprehends a set of operations that can be used to take and manage payments. They are useful in a scenario where your application needs full control of the payment cycle.

    Our team has primarily focused on flexibility and usability when building this feature in order to offer the right solutions for our clients' needs.<br />
    Here are a few items to highlight what can be achieved by consuming the Payments API:

    - Authorize and capture payments using various types of payloads through different channels.
    - Cancel and refund payments (Fully or Partially).
    - Perform offline payments.

    The Refunds feature provides the ability to issue and manage refund transactions.

    Our platform supports two types of refunds:

    - [Referenced refunds](#operation/refundPayment) which are bound to a previously authorized payment.
    - [Unreferenced refunds](#operation/unreferencedRefund) which do not require a previous payment transaction to be referenced.

    This feature provides the ability for merchants to search for transactions within a certain period
    of time based on a wide set of filters such as order id, customer's name, operator, card number's first six or last four digits, and others.

    API consumers can use the `batchType` parameter to indicate where the search should take place.
    In other words, whether they intend to search for transactions sitting in the current open batch or for captured and settled transactions in one of the closed batches.

    Being able to process cross-border payments is a great business advantage.
    However, international credit card payments are typically made in the merchant's base currency,
    and converted subsequently by the card's issuing bank to the buyer’s home currency, with the cardholder paying a foreign exchange conversion fee to the card issuer.
    This might lead to disputes and chargebacks that sometimes occur as a result of pricing discrepancies when credits are issued.

    To overcome those challenges, you can make use of our Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) solution, a smart alternative that gives international Mastercard, VISA and Diners customers the choice to pay in their home currency.
    With DCC, your customers will know exactly what their total purchase amount is in their home currency at the time you process the transaction.

    ### How it works

    1. You initiate a payment like you usually do by capture the card details.
    2. The [DCC Rates Inquiry](#operation/getDccFxRates) endpoint is used to retrieve the foreign exchange rates.
    3. If the currency differs from the local currency and the card qualifies for DCC, you will receive what we call a **DCC Offer**.
    4. The terminal prompts a decision screen for the customer to choose between paying in the merchant's base currency or their home currency.
    5. If the customer accepts the DCC offer by choosing their home currency, the exchange rate is applied to the transaction. Otherwise, the transaction is processed in the merchant's base currency.

    ### Benefits

    - Reduces the number of disputes and chargebacks.
    - No activation fees, monthly fees or monthly minimums.
    - Peace of mind for your customers as they know exactly how much they're paying in their home currency.
    - New income stream. You'll receive monthly rebates in respect of DCC transactions processed on your terminal.

    ### Regulations

    The card schemes have several specific rules around what information needs to be presented to the customer before they
    make their choice of whether to accept or decline the DCC offer and what information needs to be present on the customer receipt.
    The customer must be made aware of the cost of the currency conversion and you are not permitted to force a choice on the cardholder.

    #### DCC decision screen

    Our DCC solution provides you with all the information required to offer your customer the choice to accept or decline
    DCC in a way that is fully compliant with the scheme regulations, with full disclosure of the exchange rate and fees.

    Make sure your decision screen features all the following elements:

    - A clear instruction, such as "Select Currency"
    - The exchange rate
    - Local amount and currency
    - Cardholder amount and currency
    - Mark-up % (the suffix "over ECB rate" must be appended for EEA currencies, such as 3.72% over ECB rate)
    - A clear way for the customer to either accept or decline the DCC offer
    - Disclaimer as follows

      _I have been offered a choice of currencies and have chosen to accept DCC and pay in {{Cardholder Currency}} at today’s exchange rate._

    - Provider & Source as follows

      _DCC provided by {{Provider}}. {{Provider}} receives Foreign Exchange Transaction Services from {{Source}}._

    #### Receipt requirements

    Requirements for DCC transaction receipts are very similar to those of the decision screen.
    To be compliant with current regulations, the cardholder receipt must show both amounts, both currencies, exchange rate, mark-up %, disclaimer, and service provider information.

    **Note:** If your API Key is set up to generate receipts, the information required to be compliant will be returned by the gateway in the proper order and formats, ready to be rendered on your side.

    The Refunds feature provides the ability to issue and manage bank transfer refund transactions.

    Our platform supports two types of refunds:

    - [Referenced refunds](#operation/bankTransferRefund) which are bound to a previously authorized payment.
    - [Unreferenced refunds](#operation/bankTransferUnreferencedRefund) which do not require a previous payment transaction to be referenced.

        Use this endpoint to check if the customer's card is eligible for dynamic currency conversion. If so, an offer containing the foreign exchange rate will returned in the response.<br/>The information that comes inside the offer should be used to display the DCC decision screen following the guidelines described in the previous section.

        A BIN lookup is also performed as part of this request. So, even if DCC is not available, you'll still receive information about the card, such as brand, currency, and issuing country.

      summary: Refund a Payment
      description: |-
        Returns the funds of an existing payment to the customer. Refunds can be performed on any authorized transaction in our platform, either in the Open Batch or Closed Batch. By default, you are allowed to refund any amount up to 100% of the original transaction amount. In order to prevent fraud, when multiple partial refunds are performed then the sum total of them cannot exceed 100% of the total authorized amount. The refund limit is configurable at a terminal level and if you wish to alter it please contact our support team with a reason why you need it altered.

        **Note 1:** Keep in mind that this operation can also lead to a full or partial reversal of the payment.<br />When trying to perform a refund against payments that can be voided/reversed (e.g. unsettled payments), the gateway will run a reversal.

        **Note 2:** If you need to issue a refund without referencing a previous payment, please refer to the [Unreferenced Refund](#operation/bankTransferUnreferencedRefund) operation.

      summary: Refund a Payment
      description: |-
        Returns the funds of an existing payment to the customer. Refunds can be performed on any authorized transaction in our platform, either in the Open Batch or Closed Batch. By default, you are allowed to refund any amount up to 100% of the original transaction amount. In order to prevent fraud, when multiple partial refunds are performed then the sum total of them cannot exceed 100% of the total authorized amount. The refund limit is configurable at a terminal level and if you wish to alter it please contact our support team with a reason why you need it altered.

        **Note 1:** Keep in mind that this operation can also lead to a full or partial reversal of the transaction.<br />When trying to perform a refund against transactions that can be voided/reversed (e.g. unsettled payments), the gateway will run a reversal.

        **Note 2:** If you need to issue a refund without referencing a previous transaction, please refer to the [Unreferenced Refund](#operation/unreferencedRefund) operation.

            - **UNSCHEDULED**: Transactions that are for a fixed or variable amount that don’t occur on a scheduled or regularly occurring transaction date, but when a pre-defined event happens.
            - **RECURRING**: Transactions that are processed on a regular fixed interval for a pre agreed or advised amount, where applicable. Recurring transactions don’t have a fixed duration and will continue to be processed until the cardholder cancels the agreement.
            - **INSTALLMENT**: Transactions that are processed on a regular fixed interval for a pre agreed amount for a single purchase of good or services. Unlike recurring transactions, they do have a fixed duration and must not continue to be processed after the end of the agreed instalment period
